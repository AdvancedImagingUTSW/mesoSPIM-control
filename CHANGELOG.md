* Logging is now supported.
* Reduced the output to the command line
* Improved support for a specific mesoSPIM configuration using sample & focusing stages by Steinmayer Mechantronik and in combination with PI stages for sample rotation and z-movement.

### Bugfixes:
* To decrease laggyness of the GUI in live mode and during acquisitions, display subsampling is now available. This way, less image data has to be rendered by the GUI.
