## Version [0.1.3] - September XX, 2019
* :warning: **This release removes unnecessary configuration files from the public repository - make sure to back up your mesoSPIM & ETL configuration files beforehand. In addition, old example acquisition tables (in `mesoSPIM-control\mesoSPIM\acquisitions\`) are removed as well.** 
* **New: Snap function** -- single pictures can now be taken by clicking the snap button. The filename is autogenerated from the current time. Files are saved as `.tif` which requires `tifffile` as an additional library.
* **New: Full demo mode**: `mesoSPIM-control` can now be run without any microscope hardware by using the `demo_config.py` configuration file. 
* Removed unnecessary microscope and ETL configuration files cluttering the repository. Changed `.gitignore` correspondingly - future changes to configuration files 
* **New: Support for Photometrics cameras**: Photometrics cameras are now supported if `PyVCAM` and the PVCAM-SDK are installed. Only the Iris 15 has been tested so far.
* **New:** Added a `CHANGELOG.md` file
* **Bugfix:** Manually entering a value in a field in the Acquisition Manager table would change values in other rows as well if the row had been copied before.
* **Bugfix:** Mark buttons and dropdown menus in the Acquisition Manager table slowed down the GUI when a lot of rows (>25) were present. As a fix, only the 
selected row shows the menu.
* **Bugfix:** Fixed #30: Zooming drop down menu often fails to update after a zoom

## Version [0.1.2] - August 19th, 2019
* **New:** Logging is now supported. Logfiles go in the `log` folder. 
* **New:** Improved support for a specific mesoSPIM configuration using sample & focusing stages by Steinmayer Mechantronik and in combination with PI stages for sample rotation and z-movement.
* **Fix:** Reduced the output to the command line
* **Fix:** To decrease laggyness of the GUI in live mode and during acquisitions, display subsampling is now available. This way, less image data has to be rendered by the GUI. 
* **Fix:** Fixed a variety of multithreading bugs.
* **Fix:** Galvo amplitude and frequency in the startup part of the configuration file are now used to set startup parameters properly
