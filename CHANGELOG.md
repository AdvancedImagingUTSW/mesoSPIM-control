## Version [0.1.3] - August XX, 2019
### Important note 
* :warning: **This release removes unnecessary configuration files from the public repository - make sure to back up your mesoSPIM & ETL configuration files beforehand** 

### New features and improvements 
* **Snap function** -- single pictures can now be taken by clicking the snap button. The filename is autogenerated from the current time. Files are saved as `.tif` which requires `tifffile` as an additional library.
* **Full demo mode**: `mesoSPIM-control` can now be run without any microscope hardware by using the `demo_config.py` configuration file. 
* Removed unnecessary microscope and ETL configuration files cluttering the repository. Changed `.gitignore` correspondingly - future changes to configuration files 
* Added a `CHANGELOG.md` file

### Bugfixes


## Version [0.1.2] - August 19th, 2019
### New features
* Logging is now supported.
* Reduced the output to the command line
* Improved support for a specific mesoSPIM configuration using sample & focusing stages by Steinmayer Mechantronik and in combination with PI stages for sample rotation and z-movement.

### Bugfixes:
* To decrease laggyness of the GUI in live mode and during acquisitions, display subsampling is now available. This way, less image data has to be rendered by the GUI. 
* Fixed a lot of multithreading bugs.
* Galvo amplitude and frequency in the startup part of the configuration file are now used to set startup parameters properly
